# Hack This Fall 2024 Submission: Project HistoryAlert

This is our submission to the Hack This Fall 2024 hackathon.
We created an android app that enables users to get daily notifications about historical events from the current day in past years, with quick access to further information and wikipedia links (https://github.com/lennovative/history_alert_android).
The other submodule (https://github.com/lennovative/history_alert) contains the tools we used to extract the information from wikipeda and also a CLI version of our software.

## The Problem our Project solves

Our software helps people to stay informed about history in a simple, engaging way, without requiring active searching.
Many people are interested in learning about historical events but donâ€™t have the time to dive into lengthy articles or keep up with history books.
By delivering a quick, daily notification highlighting an event from the same date in the past, this app offers a convenient way to learn something new each day with minimal effort.
Also its fun.
